This is a software system implemented in Java that allows admin to create and manage multiple-choice questions (MCQs) in a quiz bank. The system also enables students to log in and take quizzes generated from the question bank.


## Technology Used :
- Intellij
- JDK 11


## Functionalities :
- Admin users can log in with their credentials and add new questions to the question bank. Save MCQs with four options and their corresponding answer key in a JSON file.
  
- Student users can log in with their credentials and take quizzes generated from the question bank. Receive 10 randomly selected questions from the quiz bank. Answer the questions and receive immediate feedback on their score. View their overall performance at the end of the quiz.

## Marks Distribution :
- if mark is above 8>= message: Excellent! You have got [marks] out of 10
- if mark is above 5>= but less than 8, message: Good. You have got [marks] out of 10
- if mark is above 2>= but less than 5, message: Very poor! You have got [marks] out of 10
